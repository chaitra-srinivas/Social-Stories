## About The Project 

Social Stories are a visual aid in the form of a narrative that illustrate unfamiliar situations, help understand rules or sometimes even coach a new skill. In an educational setting, social stories are an important tool used often to help and support students deal with changes and appropriately manage their emotions and behaviour.

Social Stories as a project aims to provide templates for commonly discussed concepts using which one can customize and develop a story with little effort. 

Social stories is designed to allow a registered user to:
- Access available stories as inspiration to create new ones
- Customize and develop new stories using templates to suit the needs of the individual student
- Use the application as a repository to save stories for future use.
